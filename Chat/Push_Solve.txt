Good question 👍 This is a very common beginner’s confusion when using GitHub between two computers (your laptop and your office PC).

👉 You do not need to create a new folder every time. The solution is to keep one GitHub repository and sync changes between both computers.

Here’s the correct workflow:

🔹 First Time (on Laptop or Office)

Clone the repo (only once on each machine):

git clone https://github.com/username/repo-name.git


This creates one folder for your project.

🔹 When You Work on Office PC

Make your changes.

Stage and commit:

git add .
git commit -m "work done in office"


Push changes to GitHub:

git push origin main

🔹 Next Time on Laptop

Instead of creating a new folder, just update your existing project folder with:

git pull origin main


This downloads the latest changes from GitHub into your existing folder.

🔹 Rule to Remember

Push after finishing work on any machine.

Pull before starting work on another machine.

That way, both your office PC and laptop stay in sync with GitHub.
✅ This avoids creating multiple folders and keeps all your work in one single project folder per computer.

Do you want me to make a step-by-step example (with command sequence) showing how you switch between laptop and office PC with GitHub?
